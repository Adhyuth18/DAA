## Prim's Algiorthm

In the given graph, if Primâ€™s algorithm is implemented, it will result in all the nodes being visited irrespective of the weights.
The graph needs to be converted into an undirected graph by replacing each directed edge with 2 edges (1 in each direction) each with same weights.


## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's allows directed graphs, but not graphs with negative weights.The weights are considered since we are penalizing them.


## Kruskal's Algorithm

This algorithm converts a given graph into the forest, considering each node as a separate tree.

## Final Conclusion- All the algorithms will work under a specific case, which is not the case today.
