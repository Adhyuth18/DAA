## Prim's Algiorthm
In the given graph, if Primâ€™s algorithm is implemented, it will result in all the nodes being visited irrespective of the weights.



The graph needs to be converted into an undirected graph by replacing each directed edge with 2 edges (1 in each direction) each with same weights.


## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's allows directed graphs, but not graphs with negative weights.
